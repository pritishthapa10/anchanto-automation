# Analysis of the `/pages` Folder

## a. What This Folder Stores

The `/pages` folder contains TypeScript files that define **Page Object Model (POM) classes** for an automated web testing framework, most likely using Playwright. Each file represents a different page or logical section of the web application under test. These classes encapsulate the locators and actions that can be performed on their respective pages, promoting code reuse, maintainability, and readability in test scripts.

## b. Structure of the Files

Each file in this folder typically follows this structure:

- **Imports**: Playwright's `Page`, `Locator`, and sometimes other page classes.
- **Class Definition**: Named after the page it represents (e.g., `LoginPage`, `ProductPage`).
- **Private Fields**: Store references to the Playwright `Page` object and various `Locator` objects for elements on the page.
- **Constructor**: Accepts a `Page` object and initializes locators using CSS or XPath selectors.
- **Methods**: Encapsulate actions (e.g., clicking buttons, filling forms) and assertions (e.g., checking if a page or element is visible) relevant to the page.
- **Documentation**: JSDoc comments are used to describe the purpose and usage of methods.

This structure is consistent with the Page Object Model best practices for UI test automation.
